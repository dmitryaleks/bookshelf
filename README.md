## A. Burkov (2019): "The Hundred-Page Machine Larning Book"

This book is a set of introduction-level notes on ML, covering basic principles, methodology, models and problems in a pretty concise manner. It doesn't put emphasis on code, but rather tries to explains general ideas and principles. It aims for bredth not depth, so it is a good summary to find out or be reminded of what is available out there in the ML world.

It comes with an accompanying Wiki that has pointers to deeper meterials for various topics touched upon in the book. Whenever there is a QR code printed inline with the chapter - follow the URL encoded in it to reach for more details.

According to the author:

```
This book is distributed on the “read first, buy later” principle. I firmly believe that paying for the content before consuming it is buying a pig in a poke. You can see and try a car in a dealership before you buy it. You can try on a shirt or a dress in a department store. You
have to be able to read a book before paying for it.

The read first, buy later principle implies that you can freely download the book, read it and share it with your friends and colleagues. If you liked the book, only then you have to buy it.
