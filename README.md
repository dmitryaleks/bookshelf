## Andriy Burkov (2019): "The Hundred-Page Machine Larning Book"

This book is a set of introduction-level notes on ML, covering basic principles, methodology, models and types of problems in a pretty concise manner (in just 130 pages). It doesn't put emphasis on code examples, but rather attempts to explains general ideas and principles. It aims for wide breadth rather than depth, so it serves as a good bird eye view level reference that can be used to find out or be reminded of what is available out there in the ML world.

It comes with a companion Wiki that has pointers to deeper meterials for various topics touched upon in the book. Whenever there is a QR code printed inline with some topic - following the URL encoded in it leads to a relevant page in the companion Wiki.

### Copyright and distribution

According to the author of the book:

> This book is distributed on the “read first, buy later” principle. I firmly believe that paying for the content before consuming it is buying a pig in a poke. You can see and try a car in a dealership before you buy it. You can try on a shirt or a dress in a department store. You have to be able to read a book before paying for it.  The read first, buy later principle implies that you can freely download the book, read it and share it with your friends and colleagues. If you liked the book, only then you have to buy it.
